NC Bachman's Sparrow Habitat Analysis
============
bacs-habitat

###Description:
Habitat analysis of NC Bachman's Sparrow occurrence data using ArcGIS geopspatial analysis from a python script. The purpose is to identify habitat associations between remotely-sensed data and BACS detections/non-detections. Currently using the LANDFIRE dataset.

###Prerequisites:
  - Python 2.7.x
  - ArcGIS 10.2
    - ArcGIS Spatial Analyst Extension


###Future:
- Add other geospatial layers to association
  - Canopy Cover
  - TNC "connectedness"
  - LiDAR canopy structure measures
- Run analysis on occupancy probability rather than binary detection data
